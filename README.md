## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Problem

Let's pair on adding a few features! This won't be a completely traditional pairing session,
but rather, you'll mostly drive and speak your thoughts out loud. We're not looking for perfect
implementation. We're looking for how you problem solve and explore the code base in order
to add features.

The landing page at http://localhost:3000 shows a list of 10 pokemon.

1. Add the ability to see the next 10 pokemon on the landing page.
1. Add the ability to see more than 10 pokemon on the landing page.
1. Add the ability to sort the pokemon on the landing page.
